I’m Greg, a geologist who likes turning tricky ideas into plain English. Today I want to explain convolution using a term miners already know: the search neighbourhood.
Start with a map in your head. It could be EM conductivity, hyperspectral, elevation—anything that varies across the ground. Now imagine placing your usual search neighbourhood on that map, the same way you do when estimating grades around a block. Wherever that neighbourhood sits, you look at the values inside it and blend them into one sensible number for the spot in the middle. Then you slide the neighbourhood across the map and repeat. That sliding, blending step is all convolution means.
Why bother? Because data and decisions live at different scales. Drill assays are tiny intervals along a hole. Rasters come as fine pixels. But mine plans run on blocks or SMUs. Convolution lets us turn those point- and pixel-level readings into block-level values before we build models or compare to production. If your SMU is 12.5 × 12.5 × 5 m, you use a neighbourhood that represents that block (or a tidy approximation of it) and average the information inside. Do this for EM, hyperspectral indices, distance-to-contact grids—anything you want as input—and everything now speaks the same block language as your output.
This also calms the “salt and pepper” look that raw maps often have. A few noisy pixels can make a good block look messy. A well-sized search neighbourhood smooths that noise without ironing out the geology. And if your deposit stretches along strike or dips a certain way, you simply shape the neighbourhood the same way—long in the direction of continuity, tighter across it—so the averaging follows the rock, not fights it.
Context matters too. A block rarely behaves in isolation. You can take two quick looks: one with a neighbourhood the size of the block, and another slightly larger to capture the surrounding halo. The first number says “what’s happening here,” the second says “what’s happening around here.” Machine learning loves that pairing because many geological signals—alteration halos, structural corridors, weathering fronts—live at more than one scale.
Sometimes the data has already been blended before it reaches you. Long assay composites are, in effect, the true grade smeared over the sample length. In special cases, with good controls and QA/QC, you can try a careful “reverse blend” to peek at finer detail. That’s just convolution run backwards. It’s not something to lean on every day, but it’s the same idea.
You’ll see this neighbourhood thinking all over practical workflows. Need a drill density map? Drop a tiny marker at each sample and move an ellipsoidal search neighbourhood across the area. Where many markers fall inside, density rises. Want to highlight contacts automatically? Use a small neighbourhood that reacts when values change quickly from one side to the other, and boundaries start to glow on the map without hand-tracing every wiggle.
A few habits keep things tidy. Keep all layers in the same coordinate system so the neighbourhood lands where you think it does. Make sure the weights inside the neighbourhood add up properly so an average stays an average. Treat edges fairly so boundary blocks don’t get short-changed. And when you’re testing a model, always recompute these neighbourhood-based features inside the validation slices, so a held-out bench doesn’t accidentally borrow information from its neighbours.
Put this into the broader workflow and it clicks. In a learn first, krige second approach, convolution with a search neighbourhood is the quiet prep step. It turns assays, rasters, and geology into honest block-support inputs. Machine learning then learns the complex, multi-source pattern at that same support. Finally, kriging stitches the remaining spatial texture into the residuals so the model looks like geology and behaves like it underground. Fewer surprises in reconciliation, cleaner maps, and a story you can explain without reaching for heavy math—that’s the payoff of thinking in search neighbourhoods.
